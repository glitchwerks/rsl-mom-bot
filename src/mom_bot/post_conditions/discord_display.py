"""Discord-only display adaptations for post-conditions.

This module exists because Discord button labels render poorly when they
carry full canonical condition strings (~30-55 chars). The shortening
applied here is *Discord-UI only* — siege-web's API surface, the web
frontend, and any future bot or consumer continue to see canonical labels
unmodified.

The :data:`SHORT_LABELS` table is the single source of truth for this
mapping.  Adding a new condition to the siege-web catalog requires adding
a corresponding entry here before it can appear on a Discord button.

Unknown raw labels raise :exc:`KeyError` to fail loudly rather than
silently fall through to the wide canonical label — a silent fall-through
would re-introduce the wide-button visual problem invisibly when siege-web
ships a new condition.

The module-level :data:`_LENGTH_INVARIANT_CHECK` assertion (evaluated at
import time) guards the 25-char visual budget.  If a future edit adds an
overlong entry the assertion fires at collection time so the CI test run
fails immediately.
