"""Seed and refresh the ``day_role_map`` table on bot startup (Epic 2.6).

Called from :meth:`~mom_bot.main.MomBot.on_ready` once the gateway is live.
Iterates the bot's guilds, finds Discord roles named ``"Attack Day {N}"`` for
days 1 and 2, and upserts them into the ``day_role_map`` table with
structured logging of any rename or snowflake-change events.

Idempotency guarantee: calling this function twice in a row with no
intervening Discord changes produces zero database writes on the second call.
The ``updated_at`` column is only bumped by SQLAlchemy on an actual UPDATE
statement, so its timestamp serves as a cheap write-audit signal in tests.
