"""Seed-on-boot logic for the reminder scheduler (plan § 4).

Provides :func:`_maybe_seed_reminders`, which inserts the two default
reminders (Hydra and Chimera) into the ``reminders`` table the first time
the bot boots with an empty table.

Design constraints (locked, plan § 3 row 13):

- **Idempotent**: only runs when ``SELECT count(*) FROM reminders == 0``.
  Subsequent boots are a no-op.
- **Env-aware**: secret names are prefixed by ``MOM_BOT_ENV`` (``dev-``
  or ``prod-``) automatically by :func:`~mom_bot.config.load_secret`.
- **KV failure exits cleanly**: if any :func:`~mom_bot.config.load_secret`
  call raises, the function logs CRITICAL and re-raises so the process
  terminates.  Container Apps will restart the pod, which retries KV on
  the next boot.  The bot must never start ticking with an empty table.

Channel resolution (#47):

- The KV secret ``reminder-channel-name`` stores the channel name as a
  plain string (e.g. ``"reminders"``).
- At first boot, the function resolves that name to a snowflake via
  ``discord.utils.get(bot.guilds[0].text_channels, name=channel_name)``.
- The resolved snowflake is stored in the ``channel_id`` DB column.
- The resolution happens once — channel renames after the first successful
  seed require a manual SQL UPDATE:
  ``UPDATE reminders SET channel_id = <new-snowflake> WHERE name = '<X>'``

Message templates are verbatim copies from ``clan_reminders.py:L128-L132``
(Hydra) and ``L141-L145`` (Chimera) per the plan's pre-work checklist.

.. note::

    ``role_mention_id`` is intentionally ``None`` for both seeded rows
    (#45). Reminders post to a dedicated channel and do not ping any role —
    the channel itself is the audience signal.  If a future need arises to
    re-add a mention for a specific reminder, use
    ``UPDATE reminders SET role_mention_id = <snowflake> WHERE name = '<X>'``
    without touching this function.

    """Insert Hydra + Chimera reminder rows if the table is empty.

    Reads one Key Vault secret via :func:`~mom_bot.config.load_secret`
    (which applies the ``MOM_BOT_ENV`` prefix automatically):

    - ``reminder-channel-name`` — Discord channel name (string) used for
      both Hydra and Chimera reminders.  Resolved to a snowflake at first
      boot via the connected discord.py client.  Both reminders fire to the
      same channel per env.

    Channel resolution uses ``discord.utils.get(bot.guilds[0].text_channels,
    name=channel_name)``.  The resolved snowflake is written into the
    ``channel_id`` DB column.  If the channel is renamed after first seed,
    use ``UPDATE reminders SET channel_id = <new-snowflake> WHERE name =
    '<X>'`` directly without re-seeding.

    Both Hydra and Chimera seed with ``role_mention_id=None`` — reminders
    post to the channel without pinging any role (#45).  If a future need
    arises to split channels, either add per-reminder secrets and update this
    function, or ``UPDATE reminders SET channel_id = ... WHERE name =
    'Chimera'`` directly without re-seeding.

    Schedule:

    - Hydra fires **Tuesday** (weekday=1) at **07:00 UTC**.
    - Chimera fires **Wednesday** (weekday=2) at **12:00 UTC**.

            already received the READY event so that ``bot.guilds`` is
            populated.  Used to resolve the channel name to a snowflake.

    Raises:
        ConfigError: If the KV secret is missing, if the bot has no guilds,
            or if the named channel does not exist in the guild.
        Exception: Any other exception raised by
