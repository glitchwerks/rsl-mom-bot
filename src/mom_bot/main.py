"""mom-bot entry point — boot discord.py client and register /ping.

Reads ``MOM_BOT_ENV`` (``dev`` or ``prod``) and resolves the bot token and
guild ID from Azure Key Vault via :mod:`mom_bot.config`.  Registers a single
guild-scoped ``/ping`` slash command that returns the bot version and uptime.

The :func:`make_client` factory is intentionally separated from
:func:`main` so tests can instantiate the client without invoking
:meth:`discord.Client.run` (which would attempt a live gateway connection).

Startup migrations (issue #94)
-------------------------------
:func:`run_migrations` is called once at the top of :meth:`MomBot.setup_hook`
— before the gateway connects and before any SQLAlchemy session is opened.
It invokes ``alembic upgrade head`` via the Python API (not the CLI) so the
correct schema is in place before the bot reads or writes any table.

This approach is safe for the SQLite-on-AzureFile topology used in Epic 2
because ``maxReplicas: 1`` + ``activeRevisionsMode: Single`` guarantee a
single concurrent writer, eliminating the usual objection to app-side
migrations.  It is a stopgap pending the Postgres migration in Epic 3 (#91),
after which CI takes responsibility for applying migrations.

Scheduler wiring (plan § 6)
----------------------------
:meth:`MomBot.setup_hook` syncs slash commands and then spawns a task that
awaits :meth:`discord.Client.wait_until_ready` before seeding reminders and
starting the scheduler loop.  Awaiting ``wait_until_ready`` directly from
``setup_hook`` would deadlock the bot (#41): discord.py calls ``setup_hook``
before ``connect()``, and the READY event (which unblocks
``wait_until_ready``) only fires after ``connect()`` runs.  The task is
stored on ``bot._reminder_task`` to prevent garbage collection.

Session factory
---------------
:func:`_build_session_factory` constructs a SQLAlchemy :class:`sessionmaker`
from the ``MOM_BOT_DATABASE_URL`` environment variable (falling back to a
local SQLite file ``./mom_bot.db`` for developer convenience).  This is
called once at startup and the factory is shared across all scheduler ticks.
