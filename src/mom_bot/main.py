"""mom-bot entry point — boot discord.py client and register /ping.

Reads ``MOM_BOT_ENV`` (``dev`` or ``prod``) and resolves the bot token and
guild ID from Azure Key Vault via :mod:`mom_bot.config`.  Registers a single
guild-scoped ``/ping`` slash command that returns the bot version and uptime.

The :func:`make_client` factory is intentionally separated from
:func:`main` so tests can instantiate the client without invoking
:meth:`discord.Client.run` (which would attempt a live gateway connection).

Scheduler wiring (plan § 6)
----------------------------
:meth:`MomBot.setup_hook` syncs slash commands and then spawns a task that
awaits :meth:`discord.Client.wait_until_ready` before seeding reminders and
starting the scheduler loop.  Awaiting ``wait_until_ready`` directly from
``setup_hook`` would deadlock the bot (#41): discord.py calls ``setup_hook``
before ``connect()``, and the READY event (which unblocks
``wait_until_ready``) only fires after ``connect()`` runs.  The task is
stored on ``bot._reminder_task`` to prevent garbage collection.

Session factory
---------------
:func:`_build_session_factory` delegates to
:func:`mom_bot.db.build_session_factory`, which constructs a SQLAlchemy
:class:`sessionmaker` from the ``MOM_BOT_DATABASE_URL`` environment variable
(falling back to a local SQLite file ``./mom_bot.db`` for developer
convenience).  For Postgres URLs, AAD-token injection is applied
automatically.  Migrations are applied by CI before deploy (Phase 3, #91) —
not at bot startup.
